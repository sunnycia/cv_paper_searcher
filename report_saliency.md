|||...For each task of the five tasks, we only preserve the saliency of the saliency map on the corresponding key components of the task, by zeroing out the saliency in other regions....|

|||...To the best of our knowledge, the newly collected dataset, containing 200 webpages, is the largest task-driven webpage saliency evaluation dataset (vs. 30 webpages in [24, 28])....|
|||...Similar to previous works [3, 12, 14], we use the following metrics for evaluation: Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL), shuffled Area Under Curve (sAUC) and Normalized Scanpath Saliency (NSS)....|

|||...For each webpage under each task, we run each method to get a saliency map....|
|||...Since the free-viewing saliency detection methods do not take a task label as input, thus always producing the same results under different task conditions....|
|||...This is perhaps because that those free-viewing saliency models tend to fire at almost all the salient regions in a webpage, thereby generating a more uniform saliency distribution that is more likely...|
|||...However, such uniform saliency predictions certainly result in more false positives, making the performance of these models worse than ours in sAUC and NSS....|

|||...Robustness of Saliency Aggregation  We now examine how the individual saliency methods that are aggregated together affect our aggregation approaches....|
|||...In our first test,  we selected the three best-performed saliency methods and aggregated them together using our image-dependent CRF aggregation method....|
|||...These two tests show the capability of our aggregation approach in making the best use of individual saliency analysis methods....|
|||...To further examine the robustness of our approach, we add a random map as one of the basic saliency maps used in aggregation....|
|||...This faked saliency detector randomly assigns each pixel a saliency value in the range [0, 1] according to a uniform distribution....|
|||...We find that our aggregation results with/without this random saliency map are almost the same, as shown in the last column of Figure 6....|
|||...Discussions  Our experiments show that saliency aggregation can consistently improve the performance of each individual saliency analysis method....|

|||...Visual saliency has been incorporated in a variety of computer vision and image processing tasks to improve their performance....|
|||...In this paper, we develop a new computational model for visual saliency using multiscale deep features computed by convolutional neural networks....|
|||...By definition, saliency is resulted from visual contrast as it intuitively characterizes certain parts of an image that appear to stand out relative to their neighboring regions or the rest of the image....|
|||...Thus, to compute the saliency of an image region, our model should be able to evaluate the contrast between the considered region and its surrounding  1  area as well as the rest of the image....|

|||...Recently, much effort has been made to design discriminative features and saliency priors....|
|||...Saliency priors, such as the center prior [26, 35, 23] and the boundary prior [22, 40], are widely used to heuristically combine low-level cues and improve saliency estimation....|
|||...These saliency priors are either directly combined with other saliency cues as weights [8, 9, 20] or used as features in learning based algorithms [22, 23, 25]....|
|||...While these empirical priors can improve saliency results for many images, they can fail when a salient object is off-center or significantly overlaps with the image boundary....|
|||...Nevertheless, CNN features have not yet been explored in visual saliency research primarily because saliency cannot be solved using the same framework considered in [11, 30]....|

|||...Spatial Coherence  Given a region decomposition of an image, we can generate an initial saliency map with the neural network model presented in the previous section....|
|||...However, due to the fact that image segmentation is imperfect and our model assigns saliency scores to individual regions, noisy scores inevitably appear in the resulting saliency map....|

|||...[27] show that the complete contrast and saliency estimation can be formulated in a unified way using high-dimensional Gaussian filters....|
|||...Most above-mentioned methods measure saliency by measuring local center-surround contrast and rarity of features over the entire image....|
|||...In this work, we exploit these cues to compute pixel saliency based on the ranking of superpixels....|
|||...We model saliency detection as a manifold ranking problem and propose a two-stage scheme for graph labelling....|
|||...From each labelled result, we compute the saliency of nodes based on their relevances (i.e, ranking) to those queries as background labels....|
|||...The four labelled maps are then integrated to generate a saliency map....|
|||...In the second stage, we apply binary segmentation on the resulted saliency map from the first stage, and take the labelled foreground nodes as salient queries....|
|||...The saliency of each node is computed based on its relevance to foreground queries for the final map....|

|||...Thus, we need to compute a degree of confidence (i.e., the saliency value) for each query, which is defined as its ranking score ranked by the other queries (except itself)....|
|||...If we compute the saliency of each query without setting the diagonal elements of A to 0, its ranking value in f  will contain the relevance of this query to itself, which is meaningless and often abn...|

|||...Two-Stage Saliency Detection  In this section, we detail the proposed two-stage scheme for bottom-up saliency detection using ranking with background and foreground queries....|

|||...To alleviate this problem and improve the results especially when objects appear near the image boundaries, the saliency maps are further improved via ranking with foreground queries....|

|||...In this paper, we present a unified saliency detection framework for handling heterogenous types of input data....|
|||...Specifically, we first select a group of potential foreground superpixels to build a primitive saliency dictionary....|
|||...In computer vision, the similar task of visual saliency aims to detect salient regions from 2D, 3D, and most recently 4D imagery data....|
|||...Robust saliency detection algorithms can benefit numerous vision and graphics tasks, ranging from automatic image cropping[26], to image thumbnailing[27], and to image/video compressing[4] and retargeting[25]....|

|||...Despite their effectiveness, saliency detection algorithms based on 2D, 3D and 4D data have adopted completely different frameworks....|
|||...In particular, the features used for distinguishing saliency candidates and more importantly the procedures for utilizing them differ significantly....|
|||...In [20] work, a disparity map is first inferred from a stereo pair and later used to enhance saliency detection....|

|||...Dictionary Construction  We define saliency dictionary as a set of superpixels S = {rs1 , rs2, ...rsk} which are regarded as the potential saliency regions and will be refined through our framework....|
|||...To get the initial saliency dictionary, we use a non-saliency dictionary to reconstruct the reference image, and patches with high reconstruction error are selected saliency dictionary....|

|||...We follow the canonical precision-recall curve(PRC) and F-measure methodologies to evaluate the accuracy of the detected saliency on databases of different dimension....|

|||...Introduction  Recently, saliency detection aimed at finding out the most important part of an image has become increasingly popular in computer vision [1, 14]....|
|||...As a pre-processing procedure, saliency detection can be used for many vision tasks, such as visual tracking [26], object retargeting [11, 39], image categorization [37] and image segmentation [35]....|
|||...Generally, methods of saliency detection can be categorized as either top-down or bottom-up approaches....|
|||...To better distinguish salient objects from background, highlevel information and supervised methods are incorporated to improve the accuracy of saliency map....|
|||...In contrast, bottom-up methods [15, 18, 22, 40, 41, 48] usually exploit low-level cues such as features, colors and spatial distances to construct saliency maps....|
|||...Secondly, a novel propagation method based on Cellular Automata [42] is introduced to enforce saliency consistency among similar image patches....|
|||...Through interactions with neighbors, boundary cells misclassified as background seeds will automatically modify their saliency values....|
|||...Many effective methods have been established to deal with saliency detection and each of them has their own superiorities [7, 17, 23, 33, 52]....|
|||...Related works  Recently, more and more bottom-up methods prefer to construct the saliency map by choosing the image boundary as the background seeds....|

|||...Therefore, video saliency estimation methods should differ substantially from image saliency methods....|
|||...In this paper we propose a novel method for video saliency estimation, which is inspired by the way people watch videos....|
|||...Image saliency is well explored in the computer vision community....|
|||...The saliency maps overlayed on the images show that video saliency is tighter and more concentrated on a single object, while image saliency covers several interesting locations....|
|||...To this end we learn a model that predicts a saliency map for a frame given the fixation map from a recent preceding moment and test it on a large set of realistic videos....|
|||...Instead, we select a set of candidate gaze locations, and compute saliency only at these locations....|
|||...Later, Koch and Ullman [20] proposed a feedforward model for the integration, along with the concept of a saliency map  a measure of visual attraction of every point in the scene....|
|||...Since then much progress in image saliency has been made....|
|||...[8] take a different approach: they concentrate on motion saliency only and detect it by using temporal spectral analysis....|
|||...Our work differs from previous video saliency methods by narrowing the focus to a small number of candidate gaze locations, and learning conditional gaze transitions over time....|
|||...Motivation and overview  Most previous saliency modeling methods calculate a saliency value for every pixel....|
|||...In our work we propose to calculate saliency at a small set of candidate locations, instead of at every pixel....|
|||...First, we observe that image saliency studies concentrate on a single image stimulus, without any prior....|
|||...For a given frame of interest we calculate the graph-based visual saliency (GBVS), proposed by Harel et al....|
|||...Given the image saliency map we wish to find the most attractive candidate regions within it....|
|||...We treat the normalized saliency map as a distribution and use it to sample a large number of random points....|
|||...Motion candidates  Modeling the saliency in independent frames is insufficient for videos since it ignores the dynamics....|
|||...The motion candidates are created from the DoG map in the same way as the static candidates are created from the image saliency map (i.e., mean-shift clustering and Gaussian fitting)....|
|||...The original frame is shown in gray (for visualization) It is overlaid with: (a) the GBVS saliency map and (b) optical flow magnitude....|

|||...Experimental validation  In this section we experimentally validate the proposed video saliency detection method....|
|||...The first metric is the area-under-curve (AUC), which utilizes the receiver-operator curve to compute the similarity between human fixations and the predicted saliency map....|
|||...Since the AUC considers the saliency results only at the locations of the ground truth fixation points, it cannot distinguish well between a peaky saliency map and a smooth one....|
|||...The 2 distance will prefer a peaky saliency map over a broad one, when comparing them to the tight distribution of the ground truth....|
|||...We compare the proposed saliency prediction approach with five different methods....|
|||...The first, referred to as humans, serves as an upper bound for the saliency prediction and measures how much the fixation map explains itself....|
|||...We further compare our results to the image saliency approach of GBVS [12], and two video saliency methods PQFT [11] and the method of Hou and Zhang [14] (annotated in figures and tables as Hou for brevity)....|
|||...Both methods are among the highest rated video saliency algorithms according to the recent benchmark of Borji et al.[3]....|
